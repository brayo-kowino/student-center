                <p>Hello! I'm Brian Odhiambo, a passionate software developer and engineer with a strong focus on technology and innovation. I specialize in Android app development and have gained significant experience in web development as well. My career is driven by a deep interest in creating impactful and user-centric technical solutions.</p>
                <p>During my high school years, I channeled my passion into electronics, personally attempting and successfully repairing devices whenever they broke down. Although I initially aimed to enroll in Computer Science classes, I ended up in Mining and Mineral Processing Engineering. Despite this, my love for computing remains steadfast.</p>
                <p>While at university, I conceived the idea for the Student Center Application, which has become one of my favorite projects. It reflects my dedication to integrating technology with practical needs, making it a significant milestone in my youthful journey.</p>
                <p>In high school, I held leadership roles as the secretary for the disciplinary committee and the class secretary. Currently, I serve as The Secretary General, Mining Engineering Society of Kenya-JKUAT and The Class Secretary for the Mining Engineering class at the university. With the encouragement and support of my classmates, I am motivated to pursue higher positions within the department, and I am committed to striving for these opportunities.</p>
                <p>In addition to my professional work, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies, coding, and playing music. My hobbies also include browsing the internet, watching TV, and walking. I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges that push the boundaries of technology.</p>
                <p>Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work.</p>
