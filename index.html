While it’s true that some have found success without formal schooling, education provides the essential skills and knowledge needed to thrive in a dynamic world. It empowers you to create your own opportunities, not just wait for employment. Whatever course you are pursuing, do it with passion and purpose. Your future is shaped by the actions you take today, and success comes from working smart, starting now."</i></b></p>
